# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a new editor by Microsoft. In this folder u'll find some small tools which could help you
working on your next project using Visual Studio Code.

# Tasks

It's possible to define build tasks for Visual Studio Code that allows you to start the build and test process
directly in your editor. Just hit CMD + SHIFT + B to start the build and CMD + SHIFT + T for the test process.
It works very well and to get your project ready in no time, copy this tasks.json into the .vscode folder within your
coding folder or start the build process and Visual Studio Code will create those files for you automatically.
